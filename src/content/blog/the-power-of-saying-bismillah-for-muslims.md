## Table of contents

You probably might have heard the slogan "safety first" in workplaces, meetings, or even just in your everyday life. An easy thought, yet powerful. Before one embarks on any task, let safety be number one. It is all about preserving one's self and others. What if I told you that, as a Muslim, we have something similar, something even deeper, that ties safety to our faith?

*It is this easy, yet powerful phrase: "Bismillah" - which means "In the name of Allah."*

## Safety and "Bismillah"

To Muslims, saying "Bismillah" before doing anything is like putting on your seatbelt before driving. It is done to ask Allah for protection and guidance. You may say it before heading into a big meeting, while on your way to work, or even before you start something as simple as having a meal or working out.

It is more than a habit of saying "Bismillah"; it is a conscious call for protection. We believe by saying it, we are acknowledging the fact that Allah is in control of all things and are pleading with Him for assistance as a means of keeping us safe in all our activities.

## Why It Matters

### Protection
The utterance of "Bismillah" is like putting on a shield: it reminds the individual that whatever he is doing-be driving to the office or patching up that leaky pipe in his home-it's not he who is doing this or that thing. It is taking an active measure of ensuring his safety by depositing all his trust into Allah.

### Mindfulness and Accountability
But it's not about safety only; instead, it's all about how one becomes precautious when he does something, saying "Bismillah". It's about doing everything the right way and in a conservative manner. When you say "Bismillah", you remind yourself to take things seriously, by procedure and not taking any shortcuts. That's where safety and faith meet.

### Rewards and Consequences
The beauty of saying "Bismillah" is that it reminds us our actions are of grave importance. When done properly, safely, and responsibly, we're not just avoiding harms but we're earning rewards from Allah as well. But the moment one skips safety, acts carelessly, and passes rules, one is close enough to harming oneself both physically and spiritually. Thus, we have a deal both ways: we look after safety, and thereby we do not only what is right for ourselves but also reap rewards in the process.

## More Than Just Personal Safety

It is very easy to think that saying "Bismillah" is just for your protection. In Islam, it is not all about you. Saying "Bismillah" before embarking on anything is also one assured way of ensuring the safety of your family and environment as well. Your actions radiate from how you drive your car to how you treat your coworkers; the aim is to make sure that those around you stay safe, too. When you utter the name of Allah, you are ensuring that your surroundings remain peaceful, safe, and secure.

So next time you're about to do something important-whether it be a work project, driving home, or cooking dinner-say, "Bismillah." It is not a habit; it is a potent, significant way of keeping yourself protected and on the right path.

Remember, safety is not all about rules and regulations; it is all about being observant and responsible, trusting in Allah. When you say "Bismillah", you align your faith and action for safety and success. A small step, yet it makes a difference.
