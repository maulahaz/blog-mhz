You know, every company these days starts their meetings with the same old slogan: "Safety first." And you know what? They're absolutely right. Safety should be the top priority for any organization - or really, for all of us in our daily lives.

But did you know that as Muslims, we've got our own version of "safety first"? It's called saying "Bismillah" - which means "In the name of Allah" in Arabic. Now, I know what you're thinking: "What's the connection between safety and saying some Arabic phrase?" Well, let me tell you, there's a strong link there.

When we say "Bismillah" before starting any task or activity, we're essentially asking Allah, the Almighty, to watch over us and keep us safe. We're acknowledging that He is in control of everything in this universe, and that we need His protection and guidance. It's like the company's "safety first" slogan, but on a deeper, spiritual level.

But it's not just about safety, my friends. When we say "Bismillah," we're also reminding ourselves to be mindful and do things the right way. We know that if we act carelessly or ignore safety protocols, we won't just be putting ourselves at risk - we might also incur the displeasure of Allah. And trust me, you don't want that.
